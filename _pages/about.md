Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the School of Computing at the University of Georgia. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor John A. Miller working on time series forecasting. Before joining the University of Georgia, I completed my Master's in Information Science at the School of Computing and Information at the University of Pittsburgh.

Research Interests:
- Time Series Forecasting
- Hierarchical Representation Learning
- Cross-variable Dependencies, Leading Indicators, and Causality
- Foundation Models for Forecasting
