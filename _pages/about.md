Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at the [School of Computing](https://computing.uga.edu/) at the University of Georgia. I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. [John A. Miller](https://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~jam/) working on time series forecasting. Before joining the University of Georgia, I completed my master's degree in 2019 at the [School of Computing and Information](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/) at the University of Pittsburgh.
